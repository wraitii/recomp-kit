// therefore keeps its own monotonic millisecond clock with exactly the
// semantics host_millis() has when no source is installed.
// --- the pinned clock -------------------------------------------------------
//
// RECOMP_PIN_CLOCK=1, or =<start>:<step>, replaces the millisecond clock
// the guest reads with a counter that moves one fixed step per PRESENTED
// FRAME. Nothing else moves it, so two runs of the same script see the same
// time at the same point in the game whatever the machine was doing.
//
// The default starts at 100 ms and advances by 50 ms per frame. Pinning here
// gives every host the same deterministic clock while still letting it boot
// and run the guest through the ordinary entry point.
//
// WHY A FRAME AND NOT A TICK
//
// The obvious alternative is to move the clock every time the guest reads it,
// or on every host tick. Both are counts that differ from run to run, which is
// the thing being removed. A frame is the guest's own unit and it is the same
// number of frames every time for a given sequence of inputs.
//
// THE STALL BREAKER, WHICH TWO ATTEMPTS NEEDED
//
// A frame alone is not enough, and the game proves it inside ten seconds. The
// front end streams a sound and waits for its play cursor to reach the end
// before it draws anything else. The cursor is modelled from this very clock,
// and the wait does not present. Pinned to frames alone the clock stops, the
// cursor stops, the wait never ends, and the run dies on the watchdog with 197
// frames and not one script step. That was measured twice, not imagined.
//
// So a POLL also moves it: any question the guest asks the host whose answer
// depends on time. boot_clock_poll() is that seam. The clock reads go through
// it, and so does anything else a host models on time - the smoke host's play
// cursor is the one that mattered here. After a fixed number of polls with no
// frame between them, the clock takes a step anyway.
//
// The threshold is far above what a frame of this game spends, so during
// ordinary play the frame is the only thing that moves the clock and the model
// above holds exactly. Only a guest that has stopped drawing and started
// waiting reaches it, which is the case that would otherwise hang. Both counts
// come from guest code, so both are the same in two runs of the same script.
//
// The step is also the guest's frame rate as the guest measures it: at 50 ms
// the game believes it is running at 20 frames a second no matter how fast the
// machine really is, so a pinned run is not a timing measurement of anything.
// The counter itself is in the runtime (host_set_time_source_pinned), so that
// every host pins the SAME clock rather than each
// keeping its own. What stays here is the part that is the host's: reading the
// environment, and the stall breaker below, which is about how a host paces a
// pinned clock and not about what a pinned clock is.
// Polls since the last frame, and how many times a run of them alone had to
// move the clock. A run whose stall count is zero was paced entirely by its
// frames.
// Atomic: the guest reads the clock from every thread it runs, and this counter
// decides when the stall breaker fires. Relaxed is enough - nothing is
// published through it and a count a step behind breaks the stall a poll later.
