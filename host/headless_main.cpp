// headless_main.cpp - boots the recompiled game from its real PE entry point
// with no window, no device and no audio, and writes every presented frame to
// a file.
//
// This is the real path, not the parity fixture: it runs `entry` (0055d6c0),
// which runs the CRT startup, WinMain, the graphics initialisation and the
// game's own main loop. Everything the guest asks the operating system for is
// answered by runtime; everything it asks DirectDraw/Direct3D for
// is answered by dx.
//
// The boot sequence itself is not here. host/boot.cpp owns
// everything the windowed host in main.mm also needs - the load, the
// heartbeat on the guest's clock, the synthesised activation, the close, the
// unwind, the watchdog and the fault handler - and this file is what is left
// once that is taken out: the caps, a presenter that writes files, and the
// run report.
//
//   1. A presenter. `host_present` is a weak no-op by default; the strong
//      definition here converts the presented surface to RGB and writes
//      build/recomp/frames/frame_NNNN.ppm. Nothing is ever displayed.
//   2. A close. Reaching the frame or wall-clock cap posts WM_CLOSE, which is
//      what closing the window does, and lets the game shut itself down
//      through its own exit path.
//   3. The run report, printed on every path a run can end on.
//
// Environment:
//   RECOMP_MAX_FRAMES=N     stop after N presented frames (default 200)
//   RECOMP_MAX_SECONDS=S    stop after S wall-clock seconds (default 180)
//   RECOMP_FRAMES=DIR       frame directory (default build/recomp/frames)
//   RECOMP_FRAME_EVERY=N    write every Nth frame (default 1; 0 writes none)
// Static GDI windows refresh at the offscreen display's 60 Hz rate. Each
// refresh is a present and advances RECOMP_PIN_CLOCK just like DirectDraw.
//   RECOMP_INPUT_SCRIPT=PATH timed keyboard/mouse script (optional)
//   RECOMP_EXE=PATH         image to load (default the loader's)
//   RECOMP_NO_ACTIVATE=1    do not synthesise activation (diagnostics)
//   RECOMP_LOG, RECOMP_IMPORT_STATS  as documented in runtime/README.md
