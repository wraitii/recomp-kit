// smoke_main.mm - the recompiled game, driven by a script, with no window.
//
// build/recomp/smoke exists so gameplay is checked before a person sees a
// build. It boots the real game exactly as the windowed host does, presses the
// buttons a script tells it to through exactly the paths a person's input
// takes, runs the real Metal renderer against an offscreen target, and then
// says whether what came out satisfies the script's expectations.
//
// It is headless by construction and by intent:
//
//   * No window, no NSApplication, no drawable. The Metal renderer draws into
//     an MTLTexture, which needs none of those.
//   * No audio device. host_audio_play measures the PCM the guest handed over -
//     which is what "was there a sound" actually asks - and plays nothing.
//   * Input is injected into the same host_input_* state the real keyboard and
//     mouse feed, announced through the same dinput_host_input_changed, and
//     posted as the same Win32 messages. A path that only a script could take
//     would be testing something the game does not do.
//
// What it cannot do is tell you the game looks right. It can tell you the
// device uploaded textures, that the scene is not black, that a sound had
// amplitude in it, and it can leave you the frames to look at.
