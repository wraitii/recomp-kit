// Three numbering systems meet here and none of them is the others:
//
//   * The host's key codes: positional, numbered as macOS virtual keys
//     (kVK_*), which is where this table started. sdl/keymap.cpp turns SDL
//     scancodes into them. Positional means they survive a non-US layout: the
//     key west of E is the same code whatever is printed on it, which is what
//     a game that reads scan codes wants.
//   * DirectInput scan codes (DIK_*), what the guest's keyboard device
//     reports through `HostInputState::keys`. These are PC set-1 scan codes.
//   * Win32 virtual key codes (VK_*), what GetAsyncKeyState and the WM_KEYDOWN
//     wParam carry.
//
// A key the game can press has to be delivered in all three, because the game
// reads its keyboard through DirectInput and its window messages through the
// message queue, and nothing says the two agree unless the host makes them.
