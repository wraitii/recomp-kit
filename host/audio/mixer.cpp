// mixer.cpp - host_audio_play and friends, on a software mixer.
//
// The shims hand out one flat channel numbering for DirectSound secondary
// buffers and QMixer channels alike (dx_alloc_audio_channel), so this file
// sees a small set of integers, each of which owns a player: a queue of
// scheduled sample buffers the render loop resamples and sums.
//
// Three things about DirectSound decide the shape of this file:
//
//   * A buffer has a play cursor that survives a Stop. GetCurrentPosition
//     after a Stop reports where it stopped, and a Play afterwards resumes
//     there. So a channel keeps its own byte cursor rather than asking the
//     player, which knows nothing once it is stopped.
//   * Pan is an attenuation of one channel, not a position (see audio.h). It
//     is applied to the samples, which is also what lets it be exact.
//   * SetFrequency takes effect immediately, mid-sound. A rate change
//     re-schedules the rest of the buffer at the new rate from the cursor it
//     had reached. The sound continues; it just continues faster.
//
// Everything the guest points at is copied on the way in: `pcm` is guest
// memory that is only valid for the duration of the call, and a channel may
// be re-scheduled long afterwards.
//
// LOCKS. Three, in a fixed order, and the order is checked rather than
// remembered:
//
//   * g_api_mutex, the outer lock, serialises the host_audio_* calls.
//   * g_data_mutex, over the channel table. Held briefly; nothing that touches
//     a player is called while it is held (audio_check_unlocked counts any
//     breach, and the count is a test seam).
//   * g_render_mutex, over the players. The render thread holds it for a
//     block; the API takes it to schedule, stop and read positions, after the
//     data lock is dropped.
//
// Completions are lock-free atomics, fired from the render loop: a stale
// generation names a playback that is already over and is ignored.
