// lives here rather than in sdl/main.cpp so a headless test can drive exactly
// the path the window drives; sdl/main.cpp is left with event decoding and
// nothing else, and smoke_main.mm keeps its own scripted delivery.
//
// PHYSICAL STATE IS NOT GUEST STATE. The keyboard's real transitions decide
// what is offered to the filter, and the guest's delivered state decides what
// the messages say. Conflating them is what makes a consumed press stick: its
// release never looks like a transition, so the filter is never told the key
// came up and every later press is answered as a repeat.
//
// Consuming one decision covers all four paths the guest has, because each is
// fed downstream of this call: the DirectInput immediate state, the buffered
// events the shim derives by diffing that state, the posted Win32 message and
// GetAsyncKeyState.
