// boot.h - the boot sequence every host of the recompiled game shares.
//
// Two programs run the same guest: build/recomp/recomp_headless writes frames to
// files, build/PopRecomp.app puts them on a screen. Everything between
// mem_init() and the guest's main loop is identical in both, so it lives here
// and neither one repeats it:
//
//   mem_init -> loader_load -> dx_register_shims -> loader_init_context
//   -> the host heartbeat on the guest's clock  -> run_entry
//
// A host supplies only what makes it that host: a `tick` called about once a
// millisecond from inside guest code, and a `report` that prints its own run
// summary. Everything else - activation, the close, the unwind, the watchdog,
// the fault handler - is the same problem with the same answer in both.
//
// Ownership: the guest runs on the thread that calls boot_run(). The unwind
// landing pad is on that thread's stack, so only that thread may take it; a
// cooperative guest thread that reaches a deadline leaves the unwinding to it.
