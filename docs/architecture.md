# Architecture

The build translates the supported executable's x86 instructions into C, then
compiles that C alongside a handwritten native runtime. At runtime the executable
supplies the original data image; its machine instructions are not executed by an
x86 emulator. The loader verifies its hash before mapping any of it.

## Guest memory and calls

`runtime/memory.cpp` owns the guest address arena and allocator. Guest pointers
remain 32-bit offsets even in a 64-bit process. The platform chooses the arena's
host address through `os_vm_reserve`; translated accessors resolve guest addresses
through `g_mem`. Harnesses allocate their own arena through the same platform API.
Code that runs guest functions against other memory exchanges bytes with
`recomp_arena_swap`. `loader.cpp` maps PE sections,
zero-fills data tails and replaces import-table entries with runtime trampolines.
`imports.cpp` decodes calls and dispatches the original calling conventions.

`runtime/x86.h` defines the register file, flags, x87 state and
instruction helpers used by generated functions. Functions retain stable guest
addresses for dispatch, hooks and diagnostics. Those addresses are identifiers,
not host pointers and not evidence of human-recovered intent.

Generated callers use `entry_ADDR` thunks. Those small, separately compiled
thunks supply the current dense table index to one per-image dispatch function;
hook checks, profiling and frame diagnostics no longer expand at every call.
The base-pointer table selects native replacements, while the raw-pointer table
retains translated originals. Direct, tail and computed transfers preserve their
guest stack operations. Replacement headers are compilation dependencies of
`table.c` only, in addition to native sources that explicitly include them.

Integer SSA forwards a register's PUSH value into a matching POP or LEAVE when
every memory path proves the saved slot unchanged. Unknown aliases and opaque
effects block forwarding; a call crosses only when its return stack adjustment
is known, under the x86 stack-discipline premise that a callee does not write
its caller's save slot. Bodies can prove a GPR returns its entry value even
across calls, using the callee contracts known below. This preservation contract
lets callers retain the value in host SSA while still publishing any input the
callee reads. Hooked dispatch retains its CPU reload fallback. The
register-preservation diff suite covers restoration after intermediate EBP
publication, including functions that use EBP as scratch.

Body chunks contain only local callee declarations, with no global function
list or hook indices. They start in fixed 16 KiB guest-address buckets and
split by address until their emitted bodies fit a 2 MiB source budget.
Oversized functions, including their alternate entries, stay intact in separate
files scheduled first by the build. A change can repack its own bucket, but
cannot move functions across the rest of the image. Dense-index changes can
still rebuild lightweight entry shards and the table. Shared inline semantics
in `x86.h` still require recompiling every body that includes that header.

## Threads and ownership

Original game threads are cooperatively scheduled by `runtime/kernel32.cpp`.
Each has a register file and stack, but **one guest thread holds the execution
baton at a time**. A blocking import yields it. Host workers never mutate guest
memory concurrently with that thread.

The presentation worker consumes completed immutable frames. GPU resources and
texture revisions remain alive until commands that reference them complete.
Audio queues use their own clock and synchronization. Window events publish
requests for the guest thread rather than directly executing guest functions.

Guest COM views live in guest memory as a 16-byte header (vtable address,
magic, host object id and interface id); C++ owns COM identity, interface views
and reference counts. The Rust renderer owns API state, resources and layouts
reached through the CXX bridge (`dx/d3d_bridge_helpers.h`). C++ copies scalars
and borrowed slices in for one synchronous call and writes guest results out;
Rust never holds a guest address. D3D7 and D3D8 keep device, resource metadata,
shader records and binding state in Rust.

D3D9 ownership is split by object. The factory's COM identity and references
stay in C++. Each device owns its `GpuContext`, creation and presentation
parameters in Rust; C++ keeps its COM identity, factory reference and focus
window. Rust owns vertex/index buffers, standalone surfaces and 2D/cube/volume
texture descriptors, CPU layouts/bytes, GPU resources, locks, dirty regions,
priority/LOD and byte private data. SYSTEMMEM/SCRATCH storage is CPU-only;
DEFAULT/MANAGED storage has owned wgpu handles and upload/readback paths.
C++ retains resource/device identities and per-subresource guest staging.
Texture level surfaces and volumes share the parent's Rust holder, retain the
parent COM object and cache weak child ids, avoiding a parent/child reference
cycle. Their private data uses separate Rust view namespaces. Synchronous
borrowed slices are copied before return; queued work retains its bytes and
GPU handles. Global COM reset drops holders after guest heap reset and does not
free stale guest allocations. The device owns one implicit swap chain: Rust
creates the windowed back buffer and optional auto-depth target, validates
presentation parameters for create and reset, and presents by handing the
target's texture to the presenter, falling back to an owned CPU RGBA readback;
source and destination rectangles go through a separate presented image. `Present`, `Reset`,
`TestCooperativeLevel` and the presentation caps/`Check*` answers are Rust.
A single shared loss/reset-required token is carried by the device and every
resource's GPU clone, so blocked contexts stop GPU submissions without being
classified as physical loss. `Reset` is a staged transaction: implicit targets
and each live resource's GPU storage are rebuilt from committed CPU bytes off
the live holders, holder pools are checked against the device registration,
readiness is confirmed, and only then are handles installed and the device
moved; the token's reset-required flag clears only after the last holder is
committed. A healthy `Reset` keeps the existing `GpuContext`; physical loss
stages a compatible replacement with an isolated callback token. C++ holds
implicit-surface COM identities as weak device caches, retained device lifetime
via the ref hook, and guest marshalling. Factory adapter enumeration and
`GetDisplayMode` report
the virtual desktop as the current adapter mode and reject adapters or swap
chains other than 0; an implicit surface's `GetType` is answered in C++ as
`D3DRTYPE_SURFACE`, because that classification needs no Rust resource state.
The implicit depth target uses the D3D9 depth-format mapping, not the D3D8 one.
Rust also owns declarations/FVF, shader bytecode, constants, pipeline state and
state-block snapshots/recording. C++ maps opaque handles to COM identities and
retains bound/recorded children internally; externally referenced children and
level views retain the device through ref hooks. FVF declarations have an
internal-only identity cache. Reset preserves shader/declaration objects, rejects
live state blocks and clears pipeline bindings/defaults only at final commit.
Shader translation to WGSL, drawing, fixed-function vertex processing and
event/occlusion queries are Rust; draws are batched per frame and submitted on
a worker thread. Additional swap chains and Windows resource interop are not
implemented.

D3DX buffers own bytes, constant tables own reflection data, and effects and
pools own parameters, preshaders and shared values in Rust. C++ retains the COM
identity and marshals guest calls for every D3D9 and D3DX object, and the
`d3dx9_26` effect entry points create the same Rust-backed objects as
`d3dx9_33`. Unported shader/state/query and D3DX methods fail by name.

## A frame through the host

1. The original game submits DirectDraw/Direct3D operations to `dx/`.
2. `host/d3d_render.cpp` translates draws and texture revisions into GPU commands over `host/gpu/gpu.h`.
3. `host/ui_layer.cpp` extracts UI elements from recorded blits.
4. `host/present_thread.cpp` seals the frame, retains its resources and queues it.
5. `host/compositor.cpp` combines world, UI and overlays for presentation.
6. Completion acknowledgements release resources and update frame-pacing samples.

The Classic profile aspect-fits the selected game resolution. Enhanced can
render the world at drawable resolution with separately scaled UI. Wide view
expands the world only when the drawable is wider than the selected game canvas.
Each game repository documents which rendering profiles its build supports.

## Timing, input and settings

The presentation limit is separate from simulation scheduling. Changing it must
not change the scheduler's guest-time accounting.

`host/input_gate.cpp` maps window coordinates through the published frame layout
and handles edge scrolling and focus. Relative DirectInput counts pass through
unchanged; absolute Win32 positions use the compositor's current guest mapping.
`host/controls/` holds the on-screen controls: a layout model and hit test, a
router that owns each finger, a virtual pad that on-screen and physical
controllers both write to, the overlay that draws it and the on-device editor.
The standalone `--configure` window and the launcher's Configure button offer
Controller setup; it is not part of the in-game F10 page. The controller
setup editor calibrates normalized SDL axes and routes each
physical axis, button and hat direction to guest controls.
Overview shows the connected device, live inputs and starting presets. Controller
output is always available; Mapping separates physical input selection from
explicit output choosers, with input identification. Calibration exposes
centered or one-sided axis response, drift, direction and range controls;
More options sections retain response curves, scale, offset and direction buttons.
Presets and unsaved exits require an explicit choice; Tab/Shift+Tab and Enter
operate the visible controls. Its preview runs before the game starts; Save saves
the profile under `controls/mapper-v1.txt` in the selected game profile.
Calibration includes center and range capture, radial stick and per-axis
deadzones, saturation, response curves and inversion. Output scale and offset
allow pedals to feed separate axes or opposite halves of a combined axis.
The pad is always exposed natively through DirectInput and XInput; legacy
`pad = "mapped"`/`"off"` keys in older profiles are read and ignored.
Games that enumerate controllers only at startup need a restart after enabling
joystick exposure. The current SDL host opens the first recognized controller;
calibration is stored per game profile, not separately for each physical device.
DirectInput and XInput still report delivered state to the runtime monitor; the
pre-game editor shows its draft output rather than unavailable guest reads.
Guest-requested DirectInput ranges and formats remain authoritative. The
calibration and mapping model is SDL-free; existing controls and pad suites
exercise the underlying input and API adapters.
The optional `controller_preview` build target renders the editor to a PPM
without starting the game or opening a window. Run it with an output path and
`overview`, `mapping`, `axis`, `advanced`, `calibration`, `response`, `presets`,
`discard` or `disconnected`; optional width, height and DPI scale follow.
See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-touch-controls-design.md`.
`mods/display_settings.cpp` validates the host window and performance-overlay
choices. `mods/settings.cpp` atomically persists host and
mod settings in the selected profile; each game's own menu can open the shared
settings page through the mod API.

## Discovery, and code a build does not carry

The Ghidra code map is the authority on where code is, and it can miss some: a
function only ever reached through a pointer nothing resolves, a jump-table
slot no listing owns, a block Ghidra ended early. Each shows up at run time as
a call or jump the address table cannot place.

The translator fills part of the gap itself: a bootstrap sweep of each image
(`bootstrap_map.py`, `discover` in `[translate]`) adds provisional bodies that the
Ghidra map does not name, and a branch into Ghidra-owned code is recorded as an
entry of its owner. Provisional bodies are emitted as decoded regions; a provisional
jump into mapped code dispatches at run time, and one into unmapped code traps.
Ghidra stays the authority: the sweep's bodies are evidence, and the fix for any of
them is to create the function or entry in Ghidra, re-export and regenerate.

`RECOMP_DISCOVERY=<file>` writes the addresses the translation still does not carry,
with the instruction that named them (`runtime/discovery.h`). Meanwhile
`runtime/interp.cpp` runs what the translation lacks, so a gap costs speed rather
than correctness.

`RECOMP_OBSERVE=<file>` writes one `site target kind count desc` row per indirect
transfer, grouped by how it resolved: `known` (translated function table), `module`
(another module's table), `shim` (Win32 import), `region` (decoded region), `interp`
(interpreted), `thunk`, and `unknown`. It is written at exit, so quit the game
normally to keep it.

## Current boundaries

The original simulation is generated code, not a hand-rewritten gameplay engine.
It intentionally retains low-level register operations. The handwritten runtime,
adapter APIs, build tools and reviewed extension points are the primary places to
contribute. Generated functions have address/symbol comments and per-instruction
provenance; change the translator or a reviewed replacement, then regenerate.

The desktop app builds on macOS, Linux and Windows; the iOS packager runs
on macOS. `src/core/` contains only shared type headers used by the retained
tests; it is not a second game engine. Capture/replay under `mods/native/`
validates prospective native replacements locally.

Platform services (threads, virtual memory, plugins, files, clocks) go through
`platform/os.h`, with POSIX and Win32 implementations; the build is
CMake with presets per platform (`CMakePresets.json`).
