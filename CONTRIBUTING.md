# Contributing

Start with a small change you can explain and verify. Useful areas include input
and window behavior, rendering correctness, audio scheduling, documentation,
portable tests and mod examples. Open an issue before a large architecture change.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later; create `.venv` and install `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Native builds on macOS: Apple Silicon, Xcode Command Line Tools and Git. CMake
  and Ninja come from `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Native builds on Linux: clang, lld and GNU make
  (`apt-get install clang lld build-essential`), plus SDL's platform headers
  listed in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`. FFmpeg builds from source; no
  FFmpeg development package is needed.
- Native builds on Windows: LLVM's clang and a Visual Studio developer
  command prompt for the Windows SDK. On Windows, use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`
  in place of `.venv/bin/python` in the commands below.
- First translation for games without a committed code map: [Ghidra 12.1.3](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_12.1.3_build).
- A Java runtime compatible with that Ghidra distribution. The documented setup
  was tested with OpenJDK 26.0.1; set `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK directory.
- Your own supported installation of the game you are building. Its
  `game.toml` names the executable and its SHA-256; the loader refuses other
  binaries because translated addresses and data layouts are tied to that
  image. Do not bypass the hash to add support for another version.

`tools/build.py --target app` builds the desktop host on macOS, Linux and
Windows; `--regenerate` runs the Python translator on each. Only the iOS
packager (`--target ios`, including `--stub`) requires macOS.

## Prepare a game installation

Building the app, running it, the game-backed suites and regenerating the
translation all require this step; generated code is never tracked. Every
command below takes `--game-dir /abs/path/to/<game>` when run from the kit;
a game repository's `tools/*.py` wrappers pass it for you.

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/setup.py \
  --game-dir /abs/path/to/the/game/repository \
  --install "/path/to/your/installed game" \
  --ghidra-home "/path/to/ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC" \
  --java-home "/path/to/your/jdk/Contents/Home"
```

Setup verifies the executable against `game.toml`, links the installation
where `developer_exe` points (ignored `<game>/original/...`), fetches the
annotation metadata `[setup]` names, and exports translation inputs into
ignored `<game>/analysis/`. It does not download the game. Existing links to
another installation and dirty metadata checkouts are preserved and reported.
The first export can take several minutes.

Games may ship an address/length map selected by `[translate] code_map`. The
translator then verifies the private executable against both the map and game
hash and generates assembly listings into `[translate] listings` automatically.
That directory must be separate from the committed map and contain only the
generated cache. Ghidra is only needed to refresh the analysis metadata.

If inputs already exist, `--link-only` validates the game link without running
Ghidra. `GHIDRA_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` can supply the tool paths instead of flags.

## Build and run

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/build.py --game-dir /abs/path/to/<game> --jobs 8
open /abs/path/to/<game>/build/<AppName>.app
```

The first build translates and compiles the original functions. Subsequent builds
reuse that archive and rebuild the handwritten host. After editing instruction
translation or its C helpers, regenerate explicitly:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/build.py --regenerate --jobs 8
```

On macOS, the first native build also downloads and builds FFmpeg 7.1.1
when CMake's `RECOMP_VIDEO` option is `ON` (the default). It uses the Xcode
Command Line Tools' compiler and make plus the existing Python/CMake/Ninja
environment; no Homebrew FFmpeg or assembler is needed. Intel macOS builds
pass `--disable-x86asm`. Source is pinned by SHA-256, automatic external
library detection is disabled, and only the selected legacy media decoders,
demuxers and the file protocol are enabled. The exact command and LGPL license are
in [third_party/ffmpeg/NOTICE.md](third_party/ffmpeg/NOTICE.md).

To disable video for an already configured game tree, run from the kit
with the venv on `PATH` (use the same build tree as `tools/build.py`):

```sh
cmake --preset macos -B /abs/path/to/<game>/build/cmake/macos -DRECOMP_VIDEO=OFF
.venv/bin/python tools/build.py --game-dir /abs/path/to/<game> --jobs 8
```

Use `-DRECOMP_VIDEO=ON` in that configure command to restore it. A fresh
game-free configure is
`cmake --preset macos-stub -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/abs/path/to/.venv/bin/python`;
the explicit interpreter avoids macOS finding Xcode's Python without the
required Python packages. Subsequent runs can use `cmake --preset macos-stub`. Add
`-DRECOMP_VIDEO=OFF` to exercise the path without FFmpeg. iOS, Android and
Linux also default to ON. Existing caches keep an explicit OFF until
reconfigured with `-DRECOMP_VIDEO=ON`.

On Linux use the same cache workflow with `--preset linux` and
`-B /abs/path/to/<game>/build/cmake/linux`. FFmpeg configures natively with
`--cc=${CMAKE_C_COMPILER}` and `--enable-pic`. Desktop staging copies the
three major-version `.so` files beside the executable and includes
`resources/ffmpeg-NOTICE.md`; CMake adds the executable's `$ORIGIN` rpath.
The Linux tarball contains these files too. The executable retains
build-tree rpaths for local runs.
Verify the package on Linux with `readelf -d` and `ldd` after moving it away
from the build tree, then launch it and check cinematic playback.

On a native Windows host, FFmpeg's configure requires MSYS2 `bash` and GNU
`make` on `PATH`. CMake locates bash beside make to avoid picking Git/WSL
by accident; missing either keeps video OFF with a status message. MinGW uses
`--target-os=mingw32`; an MSVC-ABI build uses `--toolchain=msvc` in the Visual
Studio developer environment. Native Windows CI builds with video enabled.

For Linux/macOS hosts cross-compiling Windows, set `LLVM_MINGW_ROOT` and use
`tools/build.py --preset windows-cross --target app`. The preset enables video,
using the host's POSIX shell and GNU make with llvm-mingw's compiler, resource
compiler and binutils. No MSYS2 installation is needed. FFmpeg receives an
explicit target architecture and cross prefix, so configure never executes a
Windows probe or accidentally selects the host's `dlltool`.

The Windows packager copies `avformat-61.dll`, `avcodec-61.dll`, `avutil-59.dll`
and the notice beside the app; import libraries stay in the build tree. An
explicit `-DRECOMP_VIDEO=OFF` at CMake configure time omits media support.
Repackaging with video OFF removes only staged FFmpeg files and preserves player
files. The cross-build CI loads the copied Windows DLLs under Wine and decodes a
generated Ogg tone. This checks decoder loading and PCM output, not a physical
audio device or target-OS gameplay.

For a video-enabled macOS app, check the executable and all three dylibs
with `otool -L`: only Apple system paths and the bundled `@rpath/libav*`
libraries may appear. `otool -l` must show the executable rpath
`@executable_path/../Frameworks`. Run `codesign -dv` on each dylib and
`codesign --verify --deep --strict /path/to/<AppName>.app`, then launch
using an isolated `RECOMP_PROFILE_DIR`. Bundling signs the libraries before
the app and includes the FFmpeg notice in `Contents/Resources`.

`--target smoke` builds the offscreen scripted host, `--target headless` the
minimal boot host and `--target plugins` every mod plugin. `--preset` and `--config Debug` pick the CMake preset; the
CMake tree lives in `<build root>/cmake/<preset>` and every artifact keeps its
documented path under that build root: the game's `build/` when the game lives
outside the kit, the kit's `build/` for the stub. Your default writable profile
stays there too. `RECOMP_PROFILE_DIR` selects a separate profile for an
interactive run. Keep the app in the checkout; moving it requires explicitly
configuring its game path.

## Add a game

Make a repository for the game with `game.toml` and `globals.toml` at its root,
following `games/stub/` for the keys, and add this kit as a submodule at `kit/`. Build with
`kit/tools/build.py --game-dir "$PWD"`. Nothing under `runtime/`, `dx/`,
`host/` or `platform/` may name your game; put addresses under `[hooks]` and
use the generated `RECOMP_HOOK_*` macros.

## Check your change

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py           # No game files required
.venv/bin/python tools/format.py         # Check handwritten C/C++/Objective-C
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --native  # Runtime, DirectX and Metal tests on macOS; portable suites everywhere
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --mods    # Build the app first; real game-backed mod tests
```

The test runner describes missing prerequisites rather than silently skipping a
requested suite. Detailed limits and the manual input/audio checklist are in
[Testing](docs/testing.md). Save files and logs from tests use ignored scratch
profiles; do not attach original game files or personal saves to issues.

## Code conventions

- Use descriptive names in handwritten code and keep functions focused on one job.
- Comment each major function's purpose, significant inputs/outputs, ownership,
  failure behavior and thread assumptions. Explain unusual arithmetic or layout
  constraints where they occur. Avoid comments that merely restate the name.
- Run `.venv/bin/python tools/format.py --write` for native code. Do not format
  `third_party/` or generated game code; their upstream/generated layout is intentional.
- Keep guest addresses as 32-bit values. Use the memory helpers rather than
  casting guest addresses into host pointers. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).
- Preserve simulation timing independently of render rate. Document whether a
  measurement describes simulation, GPU completion or frames actually displayed.
- Add focused regression coverage for behavior changes. A screenshot or counter
  alone does not establish playable-game correctness.
- Keep generated output, original game files, SDKs, credentials and private run
  artifacts out of commits. `tools/check_repo.py` checks tracked publication inputs.
