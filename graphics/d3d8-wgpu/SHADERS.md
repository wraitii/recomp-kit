# D3D8 shader-model 1.1

The guest bridge implements Create/Set/Get/DeleteVertexShader and PixelShader,
GetVertexShaderDeclaration/Function and GetPixelShaderFunction. It copies guest
bytecode and declarations into device-owned storage. Handles are above
`0xf0000000`, distinct from FVF values and shader version tokens. Queries return
required byte counts and `D3DERR_MOREDATA` for short buffers. Invalid or deleted
handles return `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`. Reset clears bindings and device constants
and retains shader objects; deleting a bound shader restores its fixed stage.

`src/d3d8/shader.rs` decodes tokens and emits WGSL. Vertex and fragment stages
can be selected independently, alongside the existing fixed-function stages.
Pipelines/modules are cached by program identities and vertex layout. Draws
retain pipelines, texture views/samplers and copies of both constant banks and
bump state, preserving queued work across later state changes and deletion.

## Supported slice

- `vs.1.1`, `ps.1.1`; other versions fail during creation by name.
- Stream-0 declarations: FLOAT1/2/3/4, D3DCOLOR, UBYTE4, SHORT2/4, SKIP and
  CONST. Float inputs extend with zero components and w=1. Packed D3DCOLOR is
  BGRA bytes converted to floating RGBA. Declaration-only shaders support the
  existing packed fixed-function FVFs; other layouts fail by name.
- 96 vertex and eight pixel float4 constants. Declaration CONST and shader DEF
  are local to the program, independent of the Set/Get device banks.
- MOV, ADD, SUB, MAD, MUL, RCP, RSQ, DP3/4, MIN/MAX, SLT/SGE, EXP/LOG,
  EXPP/LOGP, LIT, DST, LRP, FRC, M4x4/M4x3/M3x4/M3x3/M3x2, CND and DEF.
  Stage-specific instructions are rejected where not implemented. Source
  swizzles, negation, bias, signed scale (`_bx2`), complement, destination
  masks, saturation and shift modifiers are decoded. Temporaries preserve
  aliasing across partial destination writes. Relative vertex constant indexing
  uses a0.x; `DIVERGENCE(original):` indices outside the bank clamp to its bounds (original behavior
  outside the valid constant range is unverified).
- oPos, oFog, oD0/1 and oT0..7 vertex registers; four 2D texture coordinates
  reach the fragment shader. TEXCOORD, TEXKILL, TEX, TEXBEM/TEXBEML and
  TEXREG2AR/GB use four retained texture/sampler bindings. TEXBEM uses its
  **destination** stage's BUMPENVMAT00/01/10/11 state; TEXBEML also uses that
  stage's luminance scale/offset. Combiner and fixed vertex texgen/transform
  state do not affect programmable stages. Sampler filters/addressing/mip
  limits/LOD bias still apply. V8U8 bump textures retain signed U,V bytes
  through guest locks and mip uploads and sample as Rg8Snorm (B=0, A=1).
  Alpha test and fog remain raster operations.

The renderer advertises vs.1.1 / ps.1.1, 96 vertex constants,
MaxPixelShaderValue=1.0 and four simultaneous textures. Its fixed-function
combiner capacity remains two stages. These are bounded implementation caps,
not a claim of complete shader-model conformance.

Unsupported features include instruction coissue, texture matrix instruction
families, point-size outputs, multistream/tessellator declarations, shader
versions beyond 1.1, cube/volume textures and signed bump texture formats
other than V8U8. A fixed-function VS combined with a PS currently requires an existing
textured FVF and no texture transforms or generated texture coordinates. These
combinations fail by name. Full original GPU precision and
out-of-range arithmetic equivalence are unverified. Fixed-function D3D7 uses
the same renderer but gains no new bump combiner capability in this change.

## Reference and validation

The token/declaration definitions are the unchanged Wine 11.0 headers in
[third_party/wine-d3d8](../../third_party/wine-d3d8/README.md). Semantic evidence
uses that same commit's [D3D8 device](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/db11d0fe6a169c457e23d007e20404643d067aa8/dlls/d3d8/device.c),
[declaration constants](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/db11d0fe6a169c457e23d007e20404643d067aa8/dlls/d3d8/vertexdeclaration.c),
[SM1 decoder](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/db11d0fe6a169c457e23d007e20404643d067aa8/dlls/wined3d/shader_sm1.c)
and [GLSL operations](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/db11d0fe6a169c457e23d007e20404643d067aa8/dlls/wined3d/glsl_shader.c).
The WGSL emitter is first-party code; Wine source is semantic reference.

From the game repository, using its Python environment:

```sh
tools/.venv/bin/python recomp-kit/tools/test.py --game-dir "$PWD" --d3d8-wgpu test
tools/.venv/bin/python recomp-kit/tools/test.py --game-dir "$PWD" --d3d8-wgpu probe
```

The Rust suite validates composed stages with naga, rejects unsupported and
truncated tokens, checks declaration layout and embedded END bit patterns, and
performs GPU readback for independent queued pixel constant changes,
declaration-local constants and a dependent stage-3 texture read with an
off-diagonal bump matrix, independent fixed-function vertex/pixel shader
selection and padded stream-stride pipeline caching. Signed V8U8 tests cover positive,
negative and zero offsets in both channels, mip selection and texture re-upload.
Guest COM fixture tests
cover shader handle ownership, binding/deletion, bytecode/declaration size
queries and short-buffer behavior without a GPU. The existing headless probe checks fixed-function
rendering after the binding-layout extension. These tests require GPU access;
they do not establish original-D3D8 equivalence or game playability.

`RECOMP_D3D8_TRACE_SHADERS=1` prints creation handles, versions and token counts.
No original shader source or bytecode fixtures are committed.
