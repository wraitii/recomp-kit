//
//   - Called ONLY on the run thread, the one that called run_entry. A worker
//     must never service the window system, so it is never asked to.
//   - `seconds` is how long it MAY wait, a duration rather than an absolute
//     time so the host needs no agreement with the runtime about which clock.
//     Returning sooner is always safe; returning later costs latency.
//   - No runtime lock is held. The host may signal a guest event, notify
//     DirectInput, or call anything else here without deadlocking.
//   - The return value is advisory: 0 for "the time was up", non-zero for
//     "something arrived, look again". The scheduler re-checks its own
//     conditions after every call either way, so a non-zero return is a hint
//     about latency, never an assertion that any particular wait is satisfied.
//     An early return with the condition still false simply waits again.
//   - It must not block indefinitely or execute guest code: another guest
//     thread may hold the baton for the whole call.
//
// Waiting for the baton while another guest thread runs passes zero: poll host
// events without sleeping. The runtime then waits on its condition variable,
// which the returning worker wakes immediately, with a 2 ms cap to keep host
// events responsive even if the worker keeps running.

// thread, so nothing in the game ever drives the mixer by hand: QSWaveMixPump
// is called zero times in a whole run. Without a tick from somewhere a
// streamed wave plays the chunks it was given at the start and then stops,
// which is what a menu with no music sounds like.

// Passing null removes it. Only one is kept; the last registration wins.

// Register a callback for the once-a-frame seam. More than one subsystem can:
// the calls run in registration order, registering the same function twice
// registers it once, and passing NULL removes them all. See misc.cpp for why
// this is a list rather than the single slot it started as.

// MIDI. The game's music is MIDI played through a SoundFont: it looks for a
// midiOut device whose name begins with "SoundFont" (0x575e40 walks the
// devices calling midiOutGetDevCapsA and compares nine characters against the
// literal at 0x5eb5b0), opens it with no callback, and then drives it note by
// note with midiOutShortMsg. It tries SFMAN32.DLL first, which this build
// reports as missing, so the plain midiOut path is the one that runs.
//
// The host provides a synth; these are the four things the shim needs from it.
// Weak no-op defaults live in misc.cpp, so a build with no host links and
// simply reports no MIDI device, which is what the game already copes with.
//
// `sf2_path` is a host filesystem path to the SoundFont bank, already resolved
// through the file shim, or null when it could not be found. Returns non-zero
// if the synth is open.

// inside midiOutOpen, which arrives on a guest thread holding the baton, so it
