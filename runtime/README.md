# `runtime` — guest runtime, image loader and Win32 shims

This directory is the host side of the static recompilation: it owns the guest
address space, loads `D3DPopTB.exe` into it, and implements the Win32 imports
the game calls. It knows nothing about game logic; every shim implements a
Win32 contract and nothing else.

The CPU state (`struct X86`), the memory accessors (`rd32`/`wr32` and friends)
and `recomp_call` come from `runtime/x86.h`, which the translator
owns. Compile the runtime with `-I<repo root>` so `guest.h` can find it.

## Address space

Guest address `a` is `g_mem + a`.

| range | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00400000`–`loader_image_limit()` | image at its preferred base, no relocation (`0xd4c000` for this EXE, from SizeOfImage) |
| `[game] heap_base`–`heap_end` (default `0x01000000`–`0x0e000000`) | heap arena (HeapAlloc/GlobalAlloc/LocalAlloc/VirtualAlloc) |
| `0x0ef00000`–`0x0f000000` | stack, growing down |
| `0x0fe00000` | TEB: FS:[0] SEH head, FS:[4]/[8] stack bounds, FS:[0x18] self, FS:[0x2c] TLS |
| `0x0fe01000` | 64 TLS slots |
| `0x0ff00000 + 16*i` | trampoline for import `i` |

Handles are small integers outside the arena's mapped regions and are never
dereferenced: kernel objects from `0x00010004`, windows from `0x00020004`,
GDI objects from `0x00028004`, registry keys from `0x00030004`, mmio files
from `0x00040004`, pseudo modules from `0x60000000`.

`loader_init_context` sets the process-start CPU state: x87 control word
`0x037f`, clear status word, all-empty tag word `0xffff`, `fpu_top` 0, and
`eflags_misc` `0x202` so `PUSHFD` reads `0x202`. The CRT's `__ftol`,
`__ctrlfp` and `__statfp` depend on those x87 values.

## The shim contract

```c
struct ImportShim {
    const char* dll;
    const char* name;
    uint8_t     argc_stdcall;   // dwords the shim pops; ARGC_CDECL, ARGC_UNKNOWN
    void      (*fn)(X86*);      // nullptr => logging-only, returns EAX = 0
};
```

On entry to `fn`, ESP points at the guest return address and argument `i` is
`arg(c, i)` (the dword at `ESP + 4 + 4*i`). A shim writes its result with
`set_eax` (or `set_eax64` for a 64-bit result in EDX:EAX) and returns. It never
touches ESP: `imports_dispatch` pops the return address plus `4*argc_stdcall`
bytes and sets EIP, exactly as the real `ret n` would.

`ARGC_CDECL` pops only the return address. `ARGC_UNKNOWN` pops only the return
address too, but logs loudly the first time, because leaving a stdcall callee's
arguments on the stack makes the guest stack drift.

To call back into the guest — a WNDPROC, a thread body, a multimedia timer
callback — use `guest_call(c, fn_addr, a0, a1, ...)`. It pushes the arguments
right to left plus a sentinel return address, dispatches through `recomp_call`
and restores ESP.

Adding a shim means adding one row to the table at the bottom of the relevant
`.cpp`. Registration happens once in `imports_init()`. The DirectX adapter adds
COM vtable slots to the same trampoline range with:

```c
uint32_t imports_alloc_trampoline("ddraw.dll", "IDirectDraw::Blt", fn, argc);
```

Anything the loader finds in the IAT that has no registered shim still gets a
trampoline, so a call logs `DLL!name` once and returns 0 rather than jumping
into nothing. A `thiscall` method reads `this` from `c->r[R_ECX]` and its
stack arguments with `arg` as usual.

Four weanetr imports are variables rather than functions
(`BFAID_INet`, `BFAID_MODEM`, `BFSPGUID_MODEM`, `options_to_parity_table`).
Those IAT slots hold the address of zeroed guest storage instead of a
trampoline; `imports_register_data(dll, name, size)` adds more.

## `_setjmp` / `_longjmp`

The translator substitutes these by address (`_longjmp` is `0x0055db78`).
`intrinsics.h` documents the contract: prefer the two-call form, which puts the
host `setjmp` in the generated function's own frame:

```c
{ jmp_buf *b = recomp_setjmp_prepare(c); recomp_setjmp_return(c, setjmp(*b)); }
```

`recomp_setjmp(c)` exists only to catch a call site that was not translated
into that form. It cannot work, because the host `setjmp` would belong to a
frame that has returned by the time `_longjmp` fires, so it logs what the call
site should emit and aborts.

`RaiseException` and `RtlUnwind` log their arguments and abort: there is no SEH
here, so continuing would run the guest past a point Windows never reaches.

## Behaviour worth knowing before you debug something

- **The image hash is a hard gate.** `loader_load` refuses any EXE whose
  SHA-256 is not the expected one, with no override, because everything after
  it trusts that exact layout. PE parsing bounds-checks the headers, the
  section table and every import RVA against the image.
- **`GetMessageA` blocks, and owns the wait.** It drives the multimedia
  timers, calls the host's pump, and yields the scheduler baton, round and
  round until a message matching the filter arrives. The host's pump services
  its event loop once and reports whether anything is queued; it must not wait
  itself, because only `GetMessageA` knows the filter and only the runtime can
  yield the baton. With no host installed at all it returns -1, the documented
  error, rather than blocking forever or inventing a `WM_NULL`.
- **`LoadLibraryA` only succeeds for DLLs the runtime has shims for.** Anything
  else reports `ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND`, so the guest takes its own "feature
  unavailable" path instead of calling into nothing.
- **`CreateWindowExA` sends `WM_NCCREATE` then `WM_CREATE`** and honours their
  failure returns by cancelling creation, as Windows does.
- **Painting follows the window's update region, not the clock.** Showing a
  hidden window invalidates it and calls the host's window-shown hook, which is
  the transition a window manager reacts to. `UpdateWindow` sends `WM_PAINT`
  synchronously, and only when the region is dirty; `BeginPaint` validates it.
  A posted `WM_PAINT` would arrive whenever the guest next pumped, and a guest
  that never pumps would never paint.
- **A wait yields to other guest threads.** Finite waits expire only after their
  deadline, and infinite waits remain pending until satisfied or shutdown. See
  **Threads** below for ownership, suspension and deadlock diagnostics.
- **`VirtualAlloc` works in whole pages**, base and size, and `MEM_DECOMMIT`
  discards the contents so a recommit sees zeroes.
- **A message box is answered with its default button.** There is no display,
  so nobody can click it, but replying `IDOK` to an `MB_YESNO` box would hand
  the caller an answer that box never offered. `MessageBoxA`/`W` return the
  default button of the button set the caller asked for, honouring
  `MB_DEFBUTTON1/2/3`, which is what pressing Return would have given.

## Threads

`CreateThread` starts a **cooperative** thread and returns, the way Windows
does. The game needs that: both DirectInput service threads (`0052c880`
keyboard, `0052cd40` mouse) tell their creator they are ready by setting a
field it polls and then loop on `WaitForSingleObject` for the rest of the
process, so a body run to completion inside `CreateThread` never comes back.

Each guest thread owns a register file, a 256 KB guest stack, a TEB and a TLS
array, and runs on its own host thread so guest code can nest host C frames
freely. **Exactly one of them executes at a time**, named by a baton held
under a mutex. Nothing in the guest arena, the shims or the generated code
needs a lock, because there is never more than one guest instruction in
flight — the same invariant the single-threaded runtime had.

**Every call into the runtime is a scheduling checkpoint.** `imports_dispatch`
yields if the running thread has held the baton for a millisecond. Scheduling
must not depend on which API the guest happens to poll: the frame limiter spins
on `GetTickCount`, and when only blocking calls yielded it could starve the
DirectInput workers indefinitely with their 200 ms waits already expired. The
millisecond rate limit bounds the yield frequency. Translated direct, indirect,
tail and auxiliary-module calls also checkpoint, with a per-thread 1024-call
budget amortizing clock and registry work. This lets a guest-only polling loop
wait for a worker without making an OS import. The checkpoint preserves the
caller's CPU and honors `sched_atomic_enter` spans. A loop entirely within one
translated body that makes no calls remains outside this call-boundary seam.

**A thread that cannot proceed blocks.** It leaves the runnable set with a
deadline, the scheduler runs everything else, and when nothing is runnable it
sleeps until the earliest deadline instead of spinning. `Sleep(ms)` suspends
the caller for the interval; `Sleep(0)` yields, as documented.

**Nothing is released by a timeout that did not happen.** A zero timeout
answers from the current state. A finite timeout expires only once the time has
passed. An `INFINITE` wait with no runnable peer and no pending deadline is a
deadlock, and it is reported as one — with the last sixteen baton hand-offs and
every thread's state — rather than answered with `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. The host's own
run deadline ends the process in that case.

**A wait is taken when it is granted.** The scheduler decrements the semaphore,
clears the auto-reset event or takes the mutex at the moment it releases a
waiter, so one signal releases exactly one of them.

**Suspension is a count.** `SuspendThread` and `ResumeThread` both return the
previous count and a thread runs again only at zero, so two suspends need two
resumes. `CREATE_SUSPENDED` starts it at one. Suspending yourself deschedules
before the call returns.

**Locks have owners.** A `CRITICAL_SECTION` keeps `LockCount`,
`RecursionCount` and `OwningThread` where Windows keeps them; its owner
recurses and anybody else blocks. A mutex is owned recursively by one thread,
and `ReleaseMutex` from a non-owner fails with `ERROR_NOT_OWNER`. This is not
bookkeeping for its own sake: a yield inside a protected section now really can
let another thread reach the same section.

A thread that has not finished reports `STILL_ACTIVE` from
`GetExitCodeThread`, which is itself a scheduling point because a caller
polling it is spinning, and leaves a wait on its handle unsatisfied. `ExitThread` ends its own thread. `ExitProcess` called from
a guest thread cannot longjmp, because the landing pad is on the main thread's
stack: it records the request, hands the baton to the main thread and ends
itself, and the main thread performs the exit as soon as it is running again.

## The guest file system

The guest root from `game.toml` (`executable.guest_root`) maps to the
directory holding the loaded EXE. Path resolution converts `\\` to `/`,
resolves `.`/`..`, and matches each component case-insensitively against the
real directory (cached per directory, invalidated on create/delete/rename).
Relative paths resolve against the guest current directory, which starts at
the configured guest root.

## Environment variables

| variable | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `RECOMP_LOG` | `0` silent, `1` warnings and one-shot notices (default), `2` traces every import call and returned EAX |
| `RECOMP_REGISTRY` | registry backing file (default `build/recomp/registry.json`) |
| `RECOMP_CREATETHREAD=skip` | record `CreateThread` without running the thread body |
| `RECOMP_CREATETHREAD=sync` | run a thread body to completion inside `CreateThread` (pre-scheduler behaviour, for bisection) |
| `RECOMP_IMPORT_STATS=1` | at exit, classify every import as called / not reached / logging-only |

## Tests

```
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --native          # build and run
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --compile-only    # build only
.venv/bin/ctest --preset macos -R runtime_tests  # one suite
```

Run from the repository root. The tests load the real EXE, cross-check the
section mapping against `pefile`, exercise the allocator, open
`data/VCONFIG0.DAT` through a mixed-case guest path, round-trip the registry
and check that every shim leaves ESP balanced.

## MIDI out

`midiOutGetDevCapsA` reports one device called "SoundFont Synth".
`host_midi_open/short/sysex/reset/close` in `win32.h` are the host contract;
the weak defaults in `misc.cpp` accept every message and play nothing.
The host uses TinySoundFont with the bank selected during startup, before
the guest begins executing. A host without a synth remains silent.

Every one of these runs on a guest thread and holds the scheduler baton for the
whole call, so a host that blocks inside one stops every guest thread and not
just the caller. `host_midi_short` is the hot one, called per note, and must
not take a lock an audio thread can hold. Loading a large bank synchronously would freeze the game at the moment the music starts with nothing
to say why, so the open is timed.

The host now builds the synth and loads the bank before the guest starts, so
`host_midi_open` publishes what already exists and parses nothing. The timing
above therefore measures a call whose expected reading is zero, and the
threshold is two milliseconds to match: against an expectation of zero, fifty
would let a twenty-millisecond parse back in unremarked, and that stutters
every time the music starts. If it fires, the work belongs in
`host_midi_startup` rather than on a host thread - which is what the message
says, because the advice has to move with the meaning.

That is a better answer than moving the load to a host thread would have been,
and the reason is worth keeping. Loading before any guest thread exists gives
up nothing: what the baton provides is exclusion between guest threads, so a
host thread would have surrendered it - no note can arrive in the middle of an
open that builds nothing, whereas one certainly could arrive in the middle of
an open waiting on another thread. And nothing waits while holding the baton,
because nothing waits at all.

### Unsupported import diagnostics

Explicit unsupported handlers print the import name, guest registers, return
address, and every declared stdcall stack argument word before aborting, even
with `RECOMP_LOG=0`. Values are raw hexadecimal words, not inferred parameter
types; COM stack counts include `this`. Cdecl and unknown signatures have no
known argument count, so they show a labelled eight-word raw stack preview.
Out-of-arena words are marked unreadable; pointer arguments are not dereferenced.
The diagnostic is flushed to stderr and can be saved with `2>imports.log`.
Legacy null handlers also dump this information with their first enabled warning;
their existing zero-return behavior is unchanged.

A larger heap can use `[game] guest_size`, `heap_base` and `heap_end`. Keep
the heap wholly below `0x0e000000` or above `0x10000000`, clear of the fixed
mod, stack, TEB and import regions and any auxiliary modules. Guest addresses
remain 32-bit. Increasing `guest_size` alone does not enlarge the heap.

`FormatMessageA` supports a limited English system-message catalog, caller buffers
and `FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER` with `LocalFree` ownership.
DIVERGENCE(original): neutral/default language requests use English; other
languages and missing catalog entries return the corresponding Win32 lookup
errors. Source/module messages, insert formatting and width options remain named
unsupported-import failures. `FormatMessageW` retains its existing approximation.

`GetFileTime` supports optional access/write timestamps; creation-time requests
remain named unsupported failures because the portable stat seam has no birth
time. DIVERGENCE(original): timestamps retain only whole-second precision.
`ImmIsUIMessageA` classifies IME UI messages even with a null window and forwards
classified messages through `SendMessageA` when a window is supplied.

CoCreateGuid uses a one-argument stdcall shim and returns a host-entropy
version-4 GUID in guest memory, without advancing the guest RNG.
MoveFileA/W share UTF-8 path resolution and reject an existing destination.
DIVERGENCE(original): the rename seam currently cannot move files across
volumes and checks destination existence before renaming rather than atomically.
