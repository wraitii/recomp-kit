/* x86.h - guest CPU state and instruction helpers for the static recompiler.
 *
 * Emitted/owned by tools/recomp/translate.py (Task 1).  The generated C in
 * build/recomp/gen/ includes this header, and so does the runtime in
 * runtime/.  Field names are fixed by the m1-recomp plan's
 * "Global constraints" section; do not rename them.
 *
 * Conventions
 *   - All guest pointers are uint32_t.  Guest address `a` lives at g_mem + a.
 *   - Flag fields hold 0 or 1.  The translator only stores a flag when a
 *     later instruction may read it (per-function liveness), so a flag field
 *     is only meaningful where the original x86 flag was live.
 *   - x87 registers are `double` (plan ruling; not 80-bit).
