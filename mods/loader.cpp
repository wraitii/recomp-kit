// loader.cpp - discovery, load order and the transactional lifecycle.
//
//  1. Discover core then user <root>/<name>/mod.toml, validate, compute load
//     order with core strictly first, refuse
//     conflicts, cycles, duplicate ids, unmet requires and game/api
//     mismatches; print loaded and rejected mods with reasons.
//  2. Load the Lua runtime as a core plugin, ordered before every user mod.
//  3. For each mod in load order, inside one transaction: push its overlay,
//     dlopen its plugin, validate its ABI record, call pop_mod_init, run its
//     [script]. Any failure rolls back every hook, event, input subscription,
//     overlay layer, setting, menu entry, provider registration and guest
//     allocation that mod made, and the mod is reported failed. Guest memory
//     it wrote through guest_read/write is NOT rolled back - a documented
//     limitation, because the API has no record of writes outside its own
//     tracked resources. Mods that require a failed mod are rejected without
//     running their own init.
//  4. Seal the overlay layer list; the entry point runs.
//  5. Shutdown, after guest threads stop: pop_mod_exit in reverse load order,
//     every tracked resource reclaimed, then the Lua runtime last.
