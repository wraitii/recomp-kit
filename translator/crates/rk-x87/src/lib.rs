//! x87 translation. `Recipes` re-decodes each x87 instruction into typed recipes for `rk-ir`.
//! `prepare` turns the SSA's x87 effects into a per-clone event plan: it tracks the stack as
//! scalars (`scalar`), carries unpublished state across blocks (`carry`), and uses known modes to
//! choose between fast and dynamic control-word clones. Unrecognized forms fail with
//! `UnsupportedX87`.
