//! Lowers lifted p-code into codegen IR (`CgFunction`). Lowering makes flags explicit, linearizes
//! read-modify-write instructions, corrects CMOV, CMPXCHG and SSE lane shapes, identifies string
//! instructions (`string`) and replaces x87 instructions with `X87Recipes` output (`x87`). `op`
//! defines the operation vocabulary and effect properties shared by every later stage, including
//! SSA-only operations; `regs` maps SLEIGH registers to guest state lanes. Unsupported shapes
//! become `Op::Slow` instead of failing lowering.
