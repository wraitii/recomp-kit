// dsound.cpp - DirectSound: the device, secondary buffers, the 3D buffer and
// listener interfaces, and notification positions.
//
// A secondary buffer owns guest memory the game locks and fills with PCM. Play
// forwards that memory, the format and the current volume and pan to
// host_audio_play; Task 7 mixes it. A buffer created with DSBCAPS_CTRL3D also
// runs the 3D distance attenuation and stereo panning from Wine's software
// DSOUND_Calc3DBuffer, recomputed at Play and whenever a position, listener or
// other 3D parameter changes; the formula and the reference are documented
// above calc_3d.
//
// Static cross-referencing of the EXE shows IID_IDirectSound3DBuffer,
// IID_IDirectSound3DListener and IID_IDirectSoundNotify are all referenced
// from code, so all three are implemented rather than refused.

//
// The game streams music into a looping secondary buffer and does it the way
// DirectSound intends: it asks IDirectSoundNotify for an event at offset 0 and
// one at the half-way point, plays the buffer looping, and parks a worker
// thread in WaitForMultipleObjects on those two events. Every time one fires
// it refills the half the play cursor has just left. (0056ec50 creates the
// thread and the events, 0056efe0 registers the two positions and calls Play,
// 0056eb70 is the wait loop, 0056f090/00576390 are the refill and the
// Lock/copy/Unlock it ends in.)
//
// So a shim that records the positions and never signals them does not merely
// lose a notification: the worker never wakes, the second half of the buffer
// is never written, and the host loops the one half that was filled before
// Play for the rest of the run. That is what the first live run heard.
//
// Nothing here runs on a host thread. The positions are serviced whenever a
// guest thread enters this module or QSWaveMixPump, both of which happen far
// more often than the 174 ms a half-buffer lasts, and the signal itself goes
// through guest_event_signal_from_host, which queues it for the scheduler.

// CTRLFREQUENCY, `Play(0, 0, DSBPLAY_LOOPING)` while it is still empty. Then a
// dedicated thread polls GetCurrentPosition every ten milliseconds and, every
// forty, locks three or four kilobytes at its own running write offset - 0,
// 3584, 7056, 10640, ... wrapping at 32768 - and unlocks it. It stays about a
// lap ahead of the play cursor. No notification positions are ever registered
// on this path; the poll is the whole clock.
//
// So the first lap really is silence, in the original as much as here, and the
// zero-peak first buffer of the first live run was the ring as Play found it.
// What was wrong was afterwards: re-submitting the whole ring on each Unlock
// restarts the voice twenty-five times a second, which is what "garbled"
// sounds like.

// The fix is to stop pretending the ring is a loop once the guest starts
// writing into it. Ring order from the play cursor *is* play order, so the

// guest unlocks afterwards is appended behind it with host_audio_queue. The

// constant (not silent) beyond MaxDistance unless the mute flag is set. Note
// that RolloffFactor scales the distance *before* the 1/d, so it is not the
// exponent; the guest leaves it at the 1.0 default. Wine ignores the listener's
// flDistanceFactor for attenuation entirely - it only appears in its Doppler
// term - so neither do we.
//
// Panning (Wine sound3d.c 286-307, 344-361; stereo speaker table in dsound.c
// 1067-1074: speaker_angles = {-pi/2, +pi/2}, speaker_num = {left, right}):

//   left = orientFront x orientTop            (DirectX's left-handed x
//                                              already makes this point left)

// then an equal-power crossfade over the two speakers, sqrt(1-a) and sqrt(a),
// where a ramps from 0 at the left speaker to 1 at the right. A source dead
// ahead is therefore sqrt(0.5) in each channel, not unity. Position and
// listener are left-handed world coordinates and the cross product is taken
// in that convention, so no axis flip is applied.
//
// The host mixer's pan is a one-sided attenuation, not a position, so the two
// speaker gains are folded into a host volume plus a host pan. The louder
// speaker becomes the channel volume and the quieter one the pan ratio; the
// host then reproduces both gains exactly. See host/audio.h.
//
// DIVERGENCE(original): Wine converts its millibel volume with
// pow(2, lVolume/600) while the host mixer uses 10^(mb/2000). The two agree to
// about 0.3% and the second is the exact decibel definition, so the host form
// is kept. Also not reproduced: the cone fields, Doppler/velocity, and the
// flDistanceFactor influence on velocity. The guest never uses them; each logs
// once when it is set (see B3D_SetCone*/B3D_SetVelocity/SetDopplerFactor) so a
