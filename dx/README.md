# `dx` — DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectSound, DirectInput, QMixer, weanetr

The graphics, audio and input side of the static recompilation. Every file
here implements a published API contract and nothing about the game: a shim
answers the way the real DLL would, and where it cannot, it says so once in
the log rather than inventing an answer.

Most rendering and audio leave through callbacks in `host_api.h`. The optional
D3D8 bridge additionally owns an offscreen Rust/wgpu device; its CPU-only
descriptor tests compile with that backend disabled.

## Bounded D3D8 bridge

`d3d8.cpp` registers complete factory, device and surface vtables. Implemented
operations cover adapter facts, conservative capabilities, a single explicit-size
windowed color target, backbuffer descriptors/lifetime, and the host ABI's scene,
clear, transform, viewport, render-state and owned-pixel presentation operations.
Unsupported methods stop with their names; backend failures never become success.
Vertex-buffer creation/draw, textures, depth/stencil, surface locks, device reset,
fullscreen and additional swapchains are not implemented. These limits can prevent
a guest from selecting this adapter; capability bits must not be inflated to
bypass selection.

Native macOS builds optionally link the kit's `graphics/d3d8-wgpu` crate (enable it
with `RECOMP_D3D8_WGPU=1` in the environment of `tools/build.py`, or a game may ship
its own `graphics/d3d8-wgpu`, which takes precedence), exporting the D3D8 C ABI (generated into the build tree with cbindgen 0.29.4). CMake builds its locked static library, tracks all
Rust modules and checks the ABI version before use. Other platforms and builds
without it build the no-renderer path, which advertises no adapter.
The null-host target excludes GPU execution, but links Rust CPU storage when
the crate is enabled so its guest COM tests exercise the real resource
ABI. Standalone kit profiles retain C++ CPU storage. The renderer's D3D8 coverage is what the games it has run needed so far; this is
a bounded integration boundary. COM IIDs and tables are generated from a pinned
Wine header plus `d3d8_bindings.json`; see [Testing](../docs/testing.md).

## Wiring it up

`imports_init()` runs from `loader_load()` and installs logging-only entries
for these DLLs. `dx_register_shims()` replaces them, so the host must call it
**after** `loader_load()`:

```c
loader_load(...);        /* runs imports_init(), patches the IAT */
dx_register_shims();     /* upgrades the DirectX entries in place */
```

`imports_register` upgrades an already-allocated trampoline in place, so the
addresses the loader wrote into the IAT stay valid and no runtime file needs
to change. Registering twice is a no-op.

After `mem_init()` — which discards the guest heap the COM objects and
vtables live in — call `dx_reset()` before using any of this again.

## How a COM object works

A guest interface pointer is a 16-byte header on the runtime heap:

| offset | field |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `lpVtbl`, the guest address of the interface's vtable |
| 4 | `COM_MAGIC`, so a stray pointer is caught rather than followed |
| 8 | index of the host-side `ComObj` |
| 12 | which `ComIface` this view is |

The vtable is a second guest allocation holding one import trampoline per
slot, from `imports_alloc_trampoline`. A guest `call [vtbl + 4*n]` therefore
lands in `imports_dispatch`, which runs the slot's shim and then pops the
return address plus `4*argc` exactly as the real `ret n` would. **A shim never
touches ESP**, matching the contract in `runtime/imports.h`.

One host object can be reached through several interface views. An
`IDirectDraw2` and the `IDirectDraw4` a `QueryInterface` returns are two guest
pointers with two vtables and one shared refcount, as COM requires. Views are
allocated on first use and cached, so asking twice returns the same pointer.

Three relationships cross object boundaries and are handled by a per-kind
`QueryInterface` hook: a DirectDraw object asked for `IID_IDirect3D2` returns
the Direct3D object it owns; a surface asked for `IID_IDirect3DTexture2`
returns itself; a sound buffer asked for the 3D or notify interfaces returns
itself.

**Slot order is the entire contract.** Each vtable is written out in full,
including the slots that are stubs, because an interface that stopped early
would send the guest to the wrong method rather than to a missing one. The
tests assert the slot count and that no two slots share a trampoline.

## What the game actually uses

Cross-referencing the EXE's `.text` against the DirectX IID table (all 42 IIDs
are present in `.rdata` because `dxguid.lib` is linked, so presence proves
nothing; only a code reference does) gives the real inventory:

| requested from code | where |
| --- | --- |
| `IID_IDirectDraw2`, `IID_IDirectDraw4` | `0x4b03a7`, `0x520e54` |
| `IID_IDirectDrawSurface2`, `IID_IDirectDrawSurface4` | 8 and 6 sites |
| `IID_IDirect3D2`, `IID_IDirect3DHALDevice` | `0x42f020`, `0x42f03d` |
| `IID_IDirect3DMaterial2` | 3 sites |
| `GUID_SysMouse`, `GUID_SysKeyboard` | `0x52cdc7`, `0x52c907` |
| `IID_IDirectSound3DBuffer`, `IID_IDirectSound3DListener`, `IID_IDirectSoundNotify` | 4 sites |

So this build renders through Direct3D with a HAL device; there is no
software-rasterizer path to fall back on. `IID_IDirectDraw`,
`IID_IDirectDrawSurface`, `IID_IDirectDrawPalette` and `IID_IDirectDrawClipper`
are never requested by IID, but the version 1 interfaces are still implemented
in full because `DirectDrawCreate` returns one and `CreateSurface` hands one
back.

Vtable slot offsets were checked against real call sites in the Ghidra
decompilation rather than taken on trust: `IDirect3D2::FindDevice` at `+0x1c`
and `CreateDevice` at `+0x20` in `init_d3d`, `IDirectDraw2::CreatePalette` at
`+0x14` and `IDirect3DDevice2::EnumTextureFormats` at `+0x24` in
`init_d3d_hw_card`, `SetRenderState` at `+0x5c` in `set_render_states`,
`IDirect3DViewport2::SetViewport2` at `+0x44`, and
`IDirectDraw::SetCooperativeLevel` at `+0x50`.

## Behaviour worth knowing before you debug something

- **Surface pixels are guest memory.** A `Lock` hands back a real guest
  address, the guest writes through it, and the memory comparison fixture can compare
  the result. Pitch is the row width rounded up to 16 bytes, as a real driver
  aligns it.
- **`Flip` swaps the pixel pointers** of the front and back surface rather
  than copying. That is what retargeting the scan-out does, and it is what the
  guest's next `Lock` of either surface has to see.
- **Presentation happens on `Flip`, on `Unlock` of the primary, on a `Blt` or
  `BltFast` whose destination is the primary, on `ReleaseDC`, and on
  `SetPalette` or `SetEntries` affecting the visible surface.** The last one
  matters: attaching or editing a palette changes what is on screen without
  moving a pixel.
- **A back buffer never presents.** Only the visible surface does; a back
  buffer becomes visible by being flipped, not by being drawn into.
- **`GetDeviceIdentifier` reports vendor and device 0 on purpose.** The game
  matches these against a list of 1998 chipsets (Riva 128, Riva TNT, Rage Pro,
  Voodoo2, G200, Permedia2, Banshee) and takes a per-card workaround path on a
  hit. Zero is "unrecognised", which is the generic path and the only one this
  shim can honestly claim to implement.
- **The Direct3D device advertises the full documented blend, compare and
  texture-blend cap sets.** This is not padding: `init_d3d` rejects a device
  outright unless specific `dpcTriCaps` blend and alpha-compare bits are set.
  Advertising a superset is a promise the native renderer has to keep.
- **Direct3D records, it does not rasterize.** Every draw becomes one
  `host_d3d_draw` carrying the vertices, the render-state snapshot, the active
  transforms, the viewport and the texture handle. The immediate-mode
  `Begin`/`Vertex`/`Index`/`End` path accumulates into guest memory and emits
  the same single command, so the host sees one shape of input.
- **`GetDC` hands out a unique HDC but GDI cannot draw into surface memory**
  here. Anything rendered through that DC is lost. It logs once.
- **DirectInput deltas are consumed on read.** `host_input_state` clears them,
  so `poll_device` is the only reader; a second read in the same call would
  lose that frame's motion.
- **Nothing in the game drives the mixer, so the shims are driven from the
  message loop.** `QSWaveMixPump` is called zero times in a whole run: real
  QMixer runs its own mixing thread and that export is for an application that
  wants to pump it by hand. Everything that refilled a streamed wave used to
  hang off it, so nothing ever refilled one, and a streamed wave played the
  chunks it was given at the start and then stopped - which is a menu that
  plays a second of music and goes quiet. `dx_register_shims` now registers
  `qmixer_frame_pump` with `host_set_frame_pump`, and the guest's own message
  loop runs it between frames. The loop is `PeekMessageA` and only that; the
  game never calls `GetMessageA`, so anything hung off that one never runs
  either. DirectSound's notification service rides along on the same tick.
- **QMixer's `PauseChannel` stops rather than pauses**, because there is no
  host pause; `RestartChannel` replays from the start. It logs once.
- **A looping buffer the guest writes into is a stream, not a loop.** This is
  how the game plays music and speech, and the Wine trace of the original
  settles every detail of it. `0057e1e0` creates a 32768-byte buffer at
  22050 Hz stereo 16-bit with `GETCURRENTPOSITION2 | CTRLVOLUME | CTRLPAN |
  CTRLFREQUENCY`, reads its length back out of `GetCaps`, and calls
  `Play(0, 0, DSBPLAY_LOOPING)` while it is still empty. A thread then polls
  `GetCurrentPosition` every ten milliseconds and, every forty, locks three or
  four kilobytes at its own running offset - 0, 3584, 7056, 10640, wrapping at
  32768 - staying about a lap ahead of the play cursor. There are no
  notification positions anywhere on that path.

  So the first lap really is silence, in the original as much as here. What
  must not happen is re-submitting the ring on each `Unlock`, which restarts
  the voice twenty-five times a second. Ring order from the play cursor is
  play order, so the first write converts the buffer: the rest of the current
  lap is re-issued as a one-shot and everything written afterwards is appended
  with `host_audio_queue`. The cursor the guest polls is then derived from what
  the host has left to play, which is what paces the guest's own writer. A
  looping buffer nobody writes into stays a loop.

  `host_audio_stream` does the conversion at the cursor: it stops the voice
  once and reschedules immediately from where it had reached, so nothing is
  repeated and nothing is skipped, but there is a scheduling seam of a
  millisecond or two. That is deliberate. Handing over at the loop point
  instead would avoid the seam and cost up to a whole extra lap of the ring
  first - 370 ms at 32 KB and 22050 Hz stereo - on a buffer holding silence at
  that instant. It happens once per sound; everything after it is appended and
  gapless. It reports the
  offset it resumed from, and `host_audio_played_bytes` counts on from there at
  the sample rate and never goes backwards, across a re-schedule, across a
  refill and across an underrun. Reducing that modulo the ring is the whole of
  the play cursor.

  It has to be a count of what has been played and not of what is in flight.
  The guest keeps about a lap of audio in flight on purpose, so a cursor
  derived from the outstanding bytes sits a fixed distance ahead of the guest's
  own write offset - and that distance is exactly what the refill gate measures
  (`0057df10` returns the bytes from the write offset forward to the cursor,
  `0057dc80` compares that to the next chunk's length). Freeze it and the guest
  stops writing, which stops the stream, which freezes it further: the movie
  waits on a number that will not move, with nothing to show that anything is
  wrong.

  A host that answers -1 to `host_audio_stream` cannot continue a sound, and
  the ring stays a loop that is re-submitted at every refill. It says so once.
- **DirectSound notification positions are signalled.** The game has a second
  streaming path that uses them - `0056ec50` builds a worker thread and two
  events, `0056efe0` registers them at offset 0 and the half-way point of a
  `0x7800` buffer and calls `Play`, `0056eb70` parks the worker in
  `WaitForMultipleObjects` on them - and it does not appear in the traced run,
  but recording positions without signalling them would hang that worker for
  good. `dsound_pump()` compares the host play cursor against the registered
  offsets and signals what it has passed; `QSWaveMixPump` calls it because the
  game calls that every frame, and every DirectSound entry point calls it too.
- **A streamed wave is refilled through `host_audio_queue` where the host has
  it, and re-submitted where it does not.** Re-submitting restarts the voice,
  so the join is audible; it logs once when it falls back. The chunk the guest
  callback returns zero on is still played, because zero means "this was the
  last one", not "this one is bad" (`0056f090`).
- **weanetr reports failure so networking is unavailable.** The polarity is
  not a guess: at `0x413f90` the game frees its MLDPlay object when
  `StartupNetwork` returns zero, so zero is failure across MLDPlay.
  `GetCurrentMs` is the exception and returns the real clock, because the game
  calls it from dozens of places that have nothing to do with networking.

## Known gaps

- **`QSWAVEMIXOPENWAVEDATA`'s layout is unconfirmed.** The game builds it in a
  stack slot Ghidra could not reconstruct and no dynamic trace existed when
  this was written. `locate_wave` therefore accepts the pointer itself being
  RIFF data, or any of the first 16 fields pointing at RIFF data, and logs
  once when it finds neither. A wave it cannot decode still gets a valid
  handle, so the game proceeds silently rather than failing.
- **Blits between surfaces of different bit depths copy raw pixels** instead
  of converting. It logs once.
- **`DDBLT_KEYDEST` and `DDBLT_ROP` are ignored**, each with one log line.
- **Positional audio is stored, not applied**, in both DirectSound and QMixer,
  for the native host to consume when needed.

## Diagnosing a missing sound

`dx_dump` ends with a QMixer tally: waves opened and refused by reason, plays
asked for against plays delivered, and every drop counted under its cause - no
channel, channel disabled, session inactive, no host voice left, wave empty,
stream dry. The first twenty drops print a line each. "Some sounds are
missing" cannot be answered by a log of successes, and it was two counted
drops that found both of the bugs below.

Both were guesses about an SDK whose header this project does not have, and
both are now settled from evidence rather than from the guess:

- **`QSWaveMixOpenChannel`'s third argument selects what the second means.**
  QMixer.dll switches on it with `cmp eax,3` and a four-entry jump table, so it
  is 0 to 3. The game passes 2 with 15 and then plays on channels 0 upwards, so
  2 is a count. Reading it as an index left every channel the game uses
  unopened.
- **`QSWaveMixEnableChannel`'s fourth argument is not read as a mute.** The
  game calls it with 0 and then plays on the same channel and expects to hear
  it. Reading that as "disable" dropped every sound on the channel. The request
  is recorded and said once; playback is not gated on it.

- **`QSWaveMixSetVolume`'s value is a linear amplitude on 0 to 32767.** Its
  parameter handler in QMixer.dll is three instructions - `fild [edi+4]`,
  `fmul [0x180244d4]` where that constant is 3.051851e-05 or 1/32767, `fstp`
  into the channel's gain - so gain is value/32767. The game passes 14190,
  which is 0.433 or -7.3 dB. Read as hundredths of a decibel, as it was, every
  positive number clamped to unity and every sound played at full volume with
  no mix at all. A channel nobody has set is at full scale, because zero on a
  linear scale is silence rather than unity.

The 28 export arities are confirmed against the real QMixer.dll, so nothing on
that path is corrupting the guest stack.

## Diagnosing a silent run

`RECOMP_AUDIO_TRACE=N` prints the first N audio events: every `Lock`, `Unlock`,
`GetCurrentPosition` and submission on a playing buffer, with the offsets, the
lengths and the peak of what was written. It is off by default and costs
nothing when off.

The point of it is that a stream which goes quiet is one of a small number of
things, and they are told apart by which line stops appearing. No `Lock` at
all means the guest is not asking, and for the video player that means its own
cursor gate never opened, which means `GetCurrentPosition` is not advancing.
`Unlock` with `peak 0.000` means the guest is asking and writing silence.
`Unlock` with a real peak and no submission after it means the write is not
reaching the host. `build/recomp/pop_headless` boots into the same intro, so
all of this can be read off a headless run:

```
RECOMP_AUDIO_TRACE=200 RECOMP_MAX_SECONDS=25 build/recomp/pop_headless
```

Other audio diagnostics, all off by default:

- `RECOMP_AUDIO_DUMP_BUFFERS=<dir>` writes the PCM of each distinct sound the
  guest plays as `buf<id>_<hash>.wav`, in the buffer's own format. It shows
  what the guest decoded, which tells a bad decode from a bad schedule.
- `RECOMP_TRACE_IMPORTS=<substring>` logs every import whose `dll!name`
  contains the substring, with its stdcall arguments (hex and as float) and the
  guest return address, for example `IDirectSound3D`.
- `RECOMP_TRACE_FILES=1` logs file opens and reads, including `mmioOpenA`.

## DirectSound3D

3D buffers (`DSBCAPS_CTRL3D`, or a buffer asked for `IDirectSound3DBuffer`) are
attenuated and panned from the listener and buffer positions, min/max distance
and rolloff, following Wine's `DSOUND_Calc3DBuffer` (see the comment above
`calc_3d` in `dsound.cpp` for the formulas and what is from a reference versus
memory). Cones, velocity/Doppler and modes other than normal are logged once
and not applied. Ghost Recon uses only position, min/max distance, volume and
the listener position and orientation; the Windows result for the same inputs
has not been compared.

## Tests

```
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --native          # build and run
.venv/bin/python tools/test.py --compile-only    # build only
.venv/bin/ctest --preset macos -R dx_tests       # one suite
```

Run from the repository root. 4540 checks: vtable integrity, the
gradient/flip/present path the task specifies, blitting and colour keys,
`QueryInterface` identity, display-mode enumeration, the full Direct3D
pipeline through to a textured indexed draw, the DirectSound data path from a
`Lock` pointer to the bytes the host is handed, DirectSound notification
positions driven across the loop point, DirectInput state and buffered events,
a QMixer session, streamed QMixer waves fed by a synthetic guest callback on
hosts with and without a queue, weanetr's failure codes, and reference
counting against the heap block count. The audio groups are driven from the
Wine trace of the original: the streaming test uses its buffer size, format,
lock offsets and poll positions verbatim.

Every call goes through the real guest path: arguments are pushed onto a guest
stack and the shim is reached through `imports_dispatch`, the same way
recompiled code reaches it. The harness asserts after every call that the
shim popped exactly its own arguments and returned to the pushed address,
which is how a wrong `argc` in a vtable is caught. The suite is clean under
`-fsanitize=address,undefined`.
